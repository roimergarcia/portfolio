## About me

I'm a web developer, with experience in ASP.NET with VB.Net, SQL Server, Android with Kotlin, PHP with Laravel, and modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

After 17 year in the private industry, I'd also worked with many others programming languages and related technologies, shuch as: 
- [C#](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp)
- [R (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))
- [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)
- [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell)
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org)
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org)

## Projects

Most of my previous work is privative, but I'm currently working in a couple personal projects that soon will be available on [Github](https://github.com/roimergarcia?tab=repositories).

In the mean time, you can visit my blog [Variable Tecnica](https://variabletecnica.com) (mostly in spanish), to read a few post about programming.
